Lambda v/s Anonoyoums classes

The key difference between Anonymous class and Lambda expression is the usage of 'this' keyword. In the anonymous classes, ‘this’ keyword resolves to anonymous class itself, whereas for lambda expression ‘this’ keyword resolves to enclosing class where lambda expression is written.
Another difference between lambda expression and anonymous class is in the way these two are compiled. Java compiler compiles lambda expressions and convert them into private method of the class. It uses invokedynamic instruction that was added in Java 7 to bind this method dynamically.
